Hello, my name is Peter Kibet, and I recently graduated with a BSc in Information Technology. Through my studies, I have developed a strong foundation in computer programming, software development, and information systems. I am currently enrolled in a Full Stack Web Development program at Microverse online school, where I am learning essential web development skills such as HTML & CSS, Ruby, Databases, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React & Redux, Algorithms, and Data Structures. With my technical skills and knowledge, I am confident in my ability to contribute to innovative projects and add value to any team.

In addition to technical skills, I am also developing my soft skills such as effective networking, time management, cross-cultural communication, remote work best practices, how to prepare for interviews, and effective job searching.
